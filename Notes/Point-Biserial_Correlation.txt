Point-Biserial Correlation : Numeric feature and binary classification target 

Example :

>>>   pointbiserialr(dataDF["Age"], dataDF["Purchase Iphone"])
out : SignificanceResult(statistic=0.6224541988845291, pvalue=2.800233943272445e-44)

r = 0.622  â†’ This is the correlation coefficient
p = 2.80e-44 â†’ This is the p-value (used to test significance)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


-- r tells you: How strong and in what direction the relationship is.
-- p tells you: Can you trust this correlation, or is it just a fluke?



ðŸ“Œ Point-Biserial Correlation Range & Interpretation**

| Correlation (r)  | Strength         | Direction      |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| `+0.00 to +0.19` | Very Weak        | Positive       |
| `+0.20 to +0.39` | Weak             | Positive       |
| `+0.40 to +0.59` | Moderate         | Positive       |
| `+0.60 to +0.79` | Strong           | Positive       |
| `+0.80 to +1.00` | Very Strong      | Positive       |
| `-0.00 to -0.19` | Very Weak        | Negative       |
| `-0.20 to -0.39` | Weak             | Negative       |
| `-0.40 to -0.59` | Moderate         | Negative       |
| `-0.60 to -0.79` | Strong           | Negative       |
| `-0.80 to -1.00` | Very Strong      | Negative       |




ðŸ§  What is a p-value?

- A p-value helps you determine whether a result is statistically significant.
- It tells you:  
Whatâ€™s the probability that I would see this result (or something more extreme) if there were actually no real effect (null hypothesis is true)?"


What is the range of p-values?

| p-value      | Interpretation                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| > 0.05       | Not statistically significant â€” likely due to random chance    |
| â‰¤ 0.05       | Statistically significant â€” **likely a real effect**           |
| â‰¤ 0.01       | Strong evidence against null hypothesis                        |
| â‰¤ 0.001      | Very strong evidence against null                              |
| Close to 0   | Extremely strong evidence that the effect is real              |
