## ML Algorithms Implemented
- Explorartory Data Analysis
- PCA
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- K-Mean
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes

Hands-on implementation of core Machine Learning algorithms using Python and mathematics â€” built both from scratch and also with libraries like scikit-learn. Ideal for understanding the fundamentals behind the models and how they work under the hood
